# 🗣️ Argupedia

Argupedia is a web-based debate platform that enhances structured discussions through guided argumentation and rational countering. It provides a transparent way to track the state of discussions and determine which arguments hold weight.

**Deployed App:** [Argupedia](https://argupedia.netlify.app/)

## 🚀 Features

### 📜 Guided Argument Creation
- Utilises **Argument Schemes** to structure arguments in a clear and logical manner.
- Ensures that discussions remain coherent and follow structured reasoning.

### ❓ Rational Countering
- Uses **Critical Questions** to challenge arguments systematically.
- Encourages well-reasoned responses rather than unstructured debates.

### 🔍 Visual Argument Tracking
- Displays argument relationships using an interactive network graph.
- Helps users analyse discussion flow and understand argument dependencies.

### 📌 Argument Status Labelling
- Implements **Dung’s grounded semantics** to determine which arguments are **IN**, **OUT**, or **Undecided**.
- Provides a real-time overview of the discussion’s current state.

### 🌐 Web-Based Platform
- Built as a modern web app with a **React** frontend, **Express & Node.js** backend, and **MongoDB Atlas** database.
- Ensures accessibility and usability across different devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
- **Graph Visualisation:** Network Graph
- **Logic Processing:** Dung’s grounded semantics
